<p><em>Applied Modern C++</em> is a series of blog posts—written as if
they were a part of a book—dedicated to helping you learn how to write
programs using C++. Perhaps you’re taking a class on C++ programming at
university, or are needing to learn how to use C++ for your next team,
or are simply wanting to learn a new language to see how things are done
in another programming language. Whatever the case may be, welcome to
the world of C++!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-c">What is C++?</h2>
<p>A simple web-search for “what is C++?” will reveal a zillion
different answers to the question. Most of them are correct from a
certain point of view, so to get to the point, here’s a distilled
definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C++ is a programming language that prioritises performance by letting
you choose appropriate abstractions for your situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It achieves this because it’s built upon two philosophical design
pillars. The first is that there shouldn’t be any room for another
language between C++ and the hardware (except assembly). The second is
that abstractions should have as little a cost as possible: preferably
none, if we can get away with it.</p>
<h3 id="is-c-still-worth-learning">Is C++ still worth learning?</h3>
<p>Every year, people either ask or try to answer this question. It’s an
interesting question: your time is valuable, and you probably want to
know whether it’s worth investing in this particular endeavour. If
nothing else, like with most programming languages, taking the time out
to learn C++ will broaden your perspective on how to write programs. To
really answer the question, we must first ask another important
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can I <em>use</em> C++ for?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we answer this question, we should be in a position to answer
the original question. Below are a handful of well-known products that
C++ has been used to develop, some of which you probably know.</p>

<p>The list of products above are just a taste of the domains C++ is
used in. C++ is also used in driver software, audio, telecommunications,
embedded SoCs, finance, and security software. These are all enthralling
applications of C++, but, my favourite examples of C++—by far—are out of
this world. That’s right, C++ is used in space too! The <a

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover" target="_blank">Mars

<p>C++ is applicable to so many domains because it’s able to run on
pretty much any computer. We’ll look at that in detail later on.</p>
<p>We’ve seen around twenty unique domains so far, and we’re not even
close to scratching the surface on how many use-cases C++ has in the
real world. So, yes, I think you should learn C++ regardless of which
year it is. You’ll definitely be able to find something that you can do
using C++.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-series-is-written-for">Who this series is written
for</h2>
<p>This series targets programmers with at least a year’s experience
with programming. Teaching complete novices is delicate work, backed by
over four decades of peer-reviewed research into computer science
education: I’m not qualified to teach that level.</p>
<h3 id="c-is-not-a-programming-language-for-complete-novices">C++ is not
a programming language for complete novices</h3>
<p>Computer science education experts—those who have conducted
peer-reviewed research—have identified that developing the ability to
think in terms of algorithms is one of the first things that one should
learn when starting to write code. Most industrially-used programming
languages have a lot of things that will needlessly frustrate aspiring
programmers during a critical stage in their development. This is true
of C++, but also applies to other popular languages such as C, C#, Java,
Rust, and Haskell.</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out, I suggest you first learn <a
href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers"
target="_blank">Python</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/"
target="_blank">JavaScript</a>; and come back in a year’s time. However,
if your heart’s set on learning C++ first, you are still welcome: just
be prepared to spend a fair amount of time researching topics that will
be considered assumed knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-experienced-programmers">Back to experienced
programmers</h3>
<p>You’ll need at least a few programs under your belt. Other than that,
no experience is necessary. You don’t need to be well-versed in computer
science or software engineering: everything we need will be discussed as
it becomes relevant.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-know-c-before-learning-c">Do I need to know C
before learning C++?</h3>
<p>Plugging this into Google will give you a host of people saying that
because C++ is based on C, you should learn C first. This is well
intended advice, but it’s not the correct way to go about learning C++.
Just like we don’t start learning to speak contemporary English by
starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"
target="_blank">Old English</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English"
target="_blank">Middle English</a>, or even <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English"
target="_blank">Early Modern English</a>, it makes little sense to learn
C++ by starting with C. Well-written C programs look vastly different to
well-written C++ programs, and so learning C for the sake of learning
C++ will just have you writing lower quality code in both C and C++.</p>
<p>There are definitely good reasons to learn how to write programs in
C, but learning it in order to learn how to use C++ is not among
them.</p>
<h3 id="which-version-of-c-are-we-learning">Which version of C++ are we
learning?</h3>
<p>We presently use C++20, though this will likely change over time.</p>
<h2 id="series-structure">Series structure</h2>
<p>Learning C++ isn’t a small task, and so I’ve broken this series up to
help you digest the content. If you were taking this as a third-year
university course, you’d probably need around twelve or fifteen weeks
with six hours of classes.</p>
<p>There are two main sections: a section on <em>using</em>
abstractions, and one on <em>building</em> abstractions. Each section is
further divided into two modules, and each module will be comprised of
many chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Section 1: Using abstractions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1</strong> is focussed on introducing you to the
fundamentals of writing programs using C++. The goal isn’t to show you a
bunch of random C++ features in isolation, but rather to get you to a
functional level of programming. By the end of Module 1, you’ll be able
to write simple programs using C++.</li>
<li><strong>Module 2</strong> aims to get you acquainted with library
features that aren’t fundamental, but are nonetheless important for you
to start writing non-trivial programs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 2: Building abstractions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 3</strong> begins to reveal the inner workings of how
abstractions are made. Most interesting C++ programs require programmers
to build their own abstractions, so we’re finally going to get stuck
into some of the more common techniques that C++ programmers use.</li>
<li><strong>Module 4</strong> pulls the curtain back even further,
revealing more abstraction techniques than its predecessor.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a rough <a href="applied-modern-cxx-00.html">table of
contents</a>, if you’d like to see what’s ahead, but only Module 1 is
seriously fleshed out.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-structure">Chapter structure</h3>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>At the start of each chapter, there will be a list of objectives for
the chapter that outline where you’re expected to develop. The purpose
of these objectives is to communicate what the chapter’s goals are, and
what it hopes you’ll get out of the chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Following the list of objectives, you’ll be presented with a table of
outcomes. This table will help you map specific verbs to each objective,
so that you can quantify that you’ve met the objectives. For example, an
objective such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“understands what kind of a language C++ is”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a fairly lofty objective because you have no way of determining if
you do understand what kind of language C++ really is. It’s great at the
high level, but terrible at the assessment level. To ground the
objective in reality, we map each <em>objective</em> to one or more
<em>outcomes</em>, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>describe</em> the design pillars upon which C++ rests</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have some sort of schema for determining whether or not
someone understands what C++ is. The verbs that hold pedagogical meaning
are italicised, and are <a

target="_blank">defined by the New South Wales Education Standards
Authority’s Glossary of Key Words</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-to-teachers-and-experienced-programmers">A note to
teachers and experienced programmers</h3>
<p>One of this series’ underpinning philosophical points is to
<em>slowly</em> expose readers to content. It often does this by
simplifying complex topics so that they’re digestible. If something
seems incomplete or slightly off, then it’s very likely that we’re going
to be revisiting the material in a later chapter in far more detail.
While it’s likely that this series does contain mistakes, please make
sure that this isn’t a simplification for the sake of the reader before
correcting or “filling in the gaps”.</p>
<h2 id="the-c-community">The C++ community</h2>

</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a group of people who are enthusiastic about
C++, then #include &lt;C++&gt; should be your first stop. Not only is
the group into C++, but they’re also about promoting kindness in
professional workspaces, diversity, and inclusivity. Many groups are
under-represented in software engineering, and particularly in C++
spaces: we’d like to change that. One of the coolest things that the
group does is to sponsor people who are a part of under-represented
groups to go to big C++ conferences.</p>
<p>For most people, the day-to-day advantage of #include &lt;C++&gt; is
the <a href="https://www.includecpp.org/discord/"
target="_blank">Discord server</a>, where you can talk about C++,
diversity, and lots of domain-specific topics. There’s even got a
section for C++ beginners!</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/"
target="_blank">cppreference</a> is an unofficial, but extremely useful
reference on standard C++. We’ll be consulting it for documentation.</p>
<p>Since Module 1 is about grasping the basics, we’ll be using the
online editor <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1zjTqsqnz"
target="_blank">Compiler Explorer</a>. Compiler Explorer is an extremely
cheap buy-in that doesn’t involve you investing loads of time setting up
a development environment, just to write your first few programs.
Instead, we’ll get you up and running with minimal assembly; once you’re
at a functional stage, we’ll sink some time into installing and
exploring our toolchain in some detail. <strong>Each chapter will have
its own Compiler Explorer link, and you should use it to ensure that you
have the correct setup for that chapter.</strong></p>
<h3 id="how-to-succeed-with-learning-c">How to succeed with learning
C++</h3>
<p>Let’s chat about how to succeed with learning C++. Peer-reviewed
research has identified that people learning a new programming language
tend to rely on features that feel familiar from previous programming
languages; even if those features aren’t the best way to write programs
in the new language. My own experience with teaching C++ to Java
programmers at a university serves as additional evidence to those
researchers’ point. To succeed in learning C++, you really do need to
get to know C++ and be its friend, rather than an acquaintance that you
only see at the shops every now and again. As such, try and challenge
yourself to write C++ only using the features that we’ve discussed, and
don’t use anything that might “feel” familiar from your prior
experience.</p>
<p>Most chapters will have a set of quzzies and exercises for you to
complete, so that you’ve got a way to practice what we’ve covered. It’s
important that you practice writing C++ at least a few times a week so
that you meet the chapter objectives. It’s also important that you
complete more than just the examples that we work through, because those
examples are only a demonstration.</p>
<p>Another tip for success is learning how to ask for help. This is an
important skill that is rarely taught, and people often think they
already know how to ask for help, so they don’t actually master this
skill. If you take the time out to learn this from people who regularly
offer help, you’ll find that your questions will be answered more
quickly, and more richly.</p>
<p>Once you’re close to the end of the series, you should start to read
other people’s C++ code. We read code far more often than it’s written,
and different programmers have different ways of approaching problems.
Most of them won’t have read this content, and will thus be writing code
that’s influenced by other means.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to take breaks and look after yourself. Go out with
friends, practice another hobby, study for another class. Routinely eat
healthily, drink water, and get a good night’s sleep. I’ve been battling
burnout for the past few years due to perpetually programming, and many
of my friends who are also in their 20s and 30s are facing similar
issues. Mixing stuff up and taking care of yourself is a good way to
minimise burnout.</p>
